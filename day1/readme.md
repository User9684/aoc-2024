  <summary>[[ SPOILER WARNING ]]</summary>
  
  ### Input
  We are given a 2D list of numbers  
  Example:  
  - 3   4  
  - 4   3  
  - 2   5  
  - 1   3  
  - 3   9  
  - 3   3

### Part 1 Task

Order the 2D list from smallest to largest, and then add up the absolute  
 difference between the left & right.

The result of adding all of the distances together is our answer for part 1.

### Part 2 Task

Iterate over the left side of the 2D list and get the total amount of times that  
 number shows up on the right side.

Now, multiply the left number by the amount of times it shows up on the right  
 side, and save this number for later.

The result of adding all the multiplications is our answer for part 2.
